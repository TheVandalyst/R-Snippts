# R-Snippts
Small functions to make R Users life easier

This is a safe place to save my snippits and share with the world 
The naming convention used so far in this folder 

1. RSelenium function and code snippets start with "RSelenium" prefix before the file name and file name is actually a summary of the functions intention
2. IO functions and code snippets, which are basically examples and code of importing and exporting data into R , snippets under this category are grouped with "IO" prefix
3. FileManipulate prefix is intended for snippets which are used to manipulate Raw files e.g. xlsx and xls files
