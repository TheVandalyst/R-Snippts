# R-Snippts
Small functions to make R Users life easier

This is a safe place to save my snippits and share with the world 
The naming convention used so far in this folder 

1. RSelenium function start with "RSelenium" prefix before the file name and file name is actually a summary of the functions intention
2. IO functions which are basically importing and exporting data into R , snippets under this category are grouped with "IO" prefix
